My name is **Amrou Bellalouna**, and I'm a Software Engineer at [Kraken Technologies](https://kraken.tech).

## Community Work

Beyond my professional work, I'm deeply involved in the [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com) community:

- [**Core Developer**](https://www.pythondiscord.com/pages/acknowledgements/#core-developers) - contributing to the development and maintenance of the platform that serves the largest Python community on Discord
- [**DevOps Team Member**](https://www.pythondiscord.com/pages/acknowledgements/#devops-team) - helping maintain infrastructure and ensure smooth operations for thousands of community members

Python Discord is a community where developers of all skill levels come together to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate.

If you're interested in Python, I highly encourage you to [join us](https://discord.com/invite/python)!

I will try to use this space to share some of the technical lessons I ran into on my path, or some thoughts, whenever 
I have any.
