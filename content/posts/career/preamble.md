Every person has their own story, the good and the bad, the challenges we confront, the difficulties we need to pierce through,
etc.

There are a lot of success stories that are left untold, stories of people we look up to, people we implicitly use for inspiration,
people that motivate us to do our best.


I don't intend nor want to say my story is a success, I just thought that one day it might be interesting for myself to look back
on the different decisions I had to make, and that I ought to document them before I grow too old and forget about the younger me.

I also wanted to show anyone who might stumble upon this that the path is never clear, and there are several factors that
contribute and help you advance through your career.

My path hasn't really been straightforward, and I always say that I found myself in Software Engineering thanks to pure
curiosity, since I originally hold an engineering degree in Industrial Maintenance and Instrumentation.

In this series, I will try to tell my story, the different stages I had to go through, the people who helped me along the way.

I don't really know how many parts there will be here, I'll just let things flow naturally, so stick along.

Some stuff here might sound dramatic, but back when I was going through these phases, I was really struggling, and often found
myself not able to make any steps forward.


There will be nothing technical about these posts, it's only the first time that I use words to document what I had
to do to become the Software Engineer that I am today.
